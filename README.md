# MonopolyCalc

A not-so-simple calculator that can keep track of all your player's money without you having to sort the bills afterwards.

It has many functions, such as increasing a player's money, decreasing it, setting it to a certain amount, etc. Thanks to regex, it is able to decipher the meaning of a sentance even if its not perfect, and all comands are case-insensitive!

The UI has many different colors so at a quick glance you can spot problems, successes, commands, and you money amount!

## RUN!!!

To run, simply install the package, `pip install space-coder-monopoly-calc` and then run `python3 -m calc`.

If it fails, you should see if the error mentions installing python from the microsoft store. If so, you should try running `python.exe -m calc` or installing python from the microsoft store, and trying again.

To install from the Microsoft Store, open the store, search python, and install 'python 3.13' or you can try going here: https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PNRBTZXMB4Z?hl=en-us&gl=CA&ocid=pdpshare. Click 'view in store' and then install it.

To run, you can try 'calc' if on linux, but on Windows you should run either `python -m calc` or `python.exe -m calc`
