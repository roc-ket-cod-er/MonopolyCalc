# MonopolyCalc

A not-so-simple calculator that can keep track of all your player's money without you having to sort the bills afterwards.

It has many functions, such as increasing a player's money, decreasing it, setting it to a certain amount, etc. Thanks to regex, it is able to decipher the meaning of a sentance even if its not perfect, and all comands are case-insensitive!

The UI has many different colors so at a quick glance you can spot problems, successes, commands, and you money amount!
